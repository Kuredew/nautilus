## About

Nautilus is a script for creating Japanese-like text animation. It's very similar to TextEvo, but more flexible. Animation keyframes are separated based on transforms, rather than combined into a single strength property.

## Installation

- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Kuredew/nautilus/releases/latest), download ```Nautilus.zip``` from assets
- Extract the zip file, there will be a file named ```Nautilus.jsxbin``` and folder named ```nautilusAssets``` in the dist folder
- Copy to ```C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe After Effects (your version)\\Support Files\\Scripts\\ScriptUI Panels\\```
- The script will appear in ```Window > Nautilus.jsxbin```

## Roadmap

Currently, the Nautilus position follow mask point (see showcase above) only supports for regular layer positions.

In the future, I might add support for index text layer positions so that there's no need to separate text layers per letter, instead, the letter positions will directly follow the mask points on the text layer.
