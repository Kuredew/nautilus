Nautilus is a script for creating delay based animation layers. It's very similar to TextEvo, but more flexible. Animation keyframes are separated based on transforms, rather than combined into a single strength property.

Nautilus can also be used with GG_Bunkai, where GG_Bunkai is used to separate text into characters/paths, and Nautilus is used to animate text separated by GG_Bunkai.

To use Nautilus, it's recommended to precomp the layers you want to apply Nautilus to (dont worry, GG_Bunkai also have precomp option).

Currently, Nautilus has two animation modes:

Normal: Like TextEvo, the direction of the transform animation depends on the transform value you've set.

Alternate: If you've ever seen animated text in Vtuber JP's music videos, the animation in alternate mode in Nautilus follows them. The direction isn't random, but rather like this:
- The first letter comes from the bottom,
- The second letter comes from the left,
- The third letter comes from the top,
- The fourth letter comes from the right, and so on.


Thanks for using Nautilus.
